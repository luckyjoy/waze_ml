Build a Machine Learning Model: Predicting User Churn

### **Build a Machine Learning Model: Predicting User Churn**

#### **Objective:**
Develop a machine learning model using tree-based techniques to predict whether a Waze user is retained or has churned. The aim is to identify factors driving user churn.

#### **Activity Breakdown:**

**Part 1: Ethical Considerations**
- Assess the ethical implications of predicting user churn.
- Determine if the model's objective should be adjusted to ensure fairness and avoid bias.

**Part 2: Feature Engineering**
- Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.

**Part 3: Modeling**
- Build tree-based models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict user churn.
- Evaluate model performance and recommend next steps for improvement.

#### **Final Deliverable:**
- Complete the activity by answering the questions in the PACE Strategy Document and creating an Executive Summary.
